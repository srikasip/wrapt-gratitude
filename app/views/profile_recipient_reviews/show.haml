        As part of our testing phase before we launch, we're inviting gift recipients to our site to share feedback on gift recommendations that we (together with #{@profile.owner.first_name}), chose for you.
      %p.text-center.mh6
        Those gift recommendations are listed below.  Please review each gift and tell us if you like/dislike it. If you would want it as a gift &#8212; add it to your gift basket. (We are not purchasing, but adding it to the basket says to us, “yes, I would like this!”)
