              We buy gifts because we care. But we often worry we will choose the wrong gift, disappointing the very person we were hoping to delight.

              Why does this happen?

              So how do we make gift giving the pleasurable and delighting experience it is meant to be?

            %p 
              "The most important thing in the exchanging of gifts is it shows that you really know the person well, and you really care about them," said Ryan Howell, a psychologist at San Francisco State University and co-founder of

              don't buy the same gift for two of their friends&#8212;even if those friends don't know each other, would never compare the gifts, and would both enjoy the same item.
            %h4 Donate in their name

              in the

              found that people felt happier after giving in a personalized manner, via a friend or relative, than after giving an anonymous donation. So, try giving to the less fortunate in someone's name this holiday season&#8212;it might give you both a holiday glow.

              in the Journal of Marketing found that people prefer buying homemade items for loved ones and were even willing to pay as much as 17 percent more for homemade things versus mass-produced items. The findings suggest that people feel that homemade items show more love, and love is what they want to express to the gift recipient

              If there's a golden rule of gifts, though, it's this: Give experiences rather than items. People who receive experiential gifts, such as concert tickets or a zoo membership, feel more

              than people who received material items, according to researchers from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. However, 
              =link_to "a recent paper [pdf]", "http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/goodman/Giving%20Happiness.pdf", target: "_blank"
              by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and Seoul National University found that people who expect a material gift who get an experiential one instead report being satisfied anyway. In contrast, those who expect an experiential gift but get an item instead are disappointed. "If gifts are about expressing and forging love, one of the best ways to do that is with your own time," Pugh said. "That will always be a really powerful gift."
