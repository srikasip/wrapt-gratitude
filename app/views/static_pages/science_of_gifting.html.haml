              We buy gifts because we care. But we often worry we will choose the wrong gift, disappointing the very person we were hoping to delight.

              "The most important thing in the exchanging of gifts is it shows that you really know the person well, and you really care about them," said Ryan Howell, a psychologist at San Francisco State University and co-founder of

                That generally means tailoring the gift to the recipient. 
              For example, Howell told Live Science, research finds that people who want to buy

              don't buy the same gift for two of their friends&#8212;even if those friends don't know each other, would never compare the gifts, and would both enjoy the same item.
            %h4 WRAPT is a platform for giving gifts from the heart.
            %p
              Because we know that your giftee is one of a kind, our Wrapt quiz helps you easily identify what makes her tick.

              In addition,  Wrapt gifts are artisanal&#8212;of the hand-made, fair trade, and sustainable variety, making recipients feel special.

              in the Journal of Marketing found that people prefer buying homemade items for loved ones and were even willing to pay as much as 17 percent more for homemade things versus mass-produced items. The findings suggest that people feel that homemade items show more love, and love is what they want to express to the gift recipient
