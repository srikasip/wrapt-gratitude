Thanks. Here are the details.

= render "order_details"

- if @purchase_order.shipping_label.present?
  %h3
    Ship to: #{@purchase_order.customer_order.note_to}

  = link_to @purchase_order.shipping_label.url, target: '_blank' do
    Shipping Label

- else
  %p
    The shipping label isn't quite ready yet, but
    = link_to 'click here', url_for
    to check again.  It shouldn't take more than a few moments.
