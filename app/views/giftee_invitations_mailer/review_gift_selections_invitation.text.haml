= "Dear #{@profile.name},"

#{@profile.owner.first_name || 'Someone'} has been shopping for gifts for you on Wrapt, a new gift-giving site dedicated to better gifting with artisanal items, memorable experiences and funds for your wish-lists in life.

#{@profile.owner.first_name || 'He'}, together with curators from Wrapt, chose gifts for you based on answers they gave to a short quiz regarding your personality, passions and purpose.

They (as well as we!) would love to know what you think about these gifts he chose. 
Would you review and mark as liked/not liked for the reasons in the pull down menu? 

Given that this is our testing period before our actual launch, your feedback is super-helpful and appreciated.

See what #{@profile.owner.first_name || 'they'} picked out for you:
