You're invited to try WRAPT
=====

Dear Friends,
You have been invited as part of a small inner circle of friends and family, to preview our new platform for better gifting, Wrapt.

At Wrapt, we use the science of gifting and gratitude to help you get better gifts for the women (wives, daughters, friends, moms) in your life. 

What makes our gifts better? For one, we created a tool that uses technology to match who she is (personality, passions and purpose), to gifts in our collection. But then, we dug into what women want – turns out they want experiences so they feel closer, they prefer handmade and artisanal gifts, and they like practical things – contributions to causes they care about, or a group-funded idea like a bucket list trip, a home project or something they will use – dinner out, a spa trip - you get the idea. And now, Wrapt is (almost) here to help you make it happen.

We chose you to help us test it out, because you’re that kind of guy (or gal).

All you have to do is:
* Imagine a woman you need a gift for, 
* Answer a few questions about her,
* View the gifts we curated for her, and
* Let us know what you think.

There’s no buying at this stage, we just want you to test-drive our site, let us know how it worked for you and share it with her so she can weigh in. Simple. 

We thank you in advance, (and so will she).
