        .floating-container.floating-container__invite
          %h4 Invite #{@survey_response.giftee_name}!
          %p During this stage of our testing we would like to circle back with her and see how well we did. We will ask her to review gift recommendations by Wrapt, your choices and rate some of the items in our collection.
