  %p Each row is an impact for a single question, and for each choice in a multiple choice question.

  %ol
    %li Gift SKU - The same as the Wrapt SKU given when you add a gift.

    %li
      Question Code - The code given when creating the question. This is used to
      match the impact(s) to the right question.

    %li
      Question Impact - The overall impact of the answer to this question on the
      gift, from -1 to 1. This is somewhat like a multiplier for what is given in the following
      columns. -1 indicates that impacts go against the recommendation of the gift,
      0 means they have no effect, and 1 means they have the highest impact in favor
      of the recommendation.

    %li
      Slider Impact Direction - If the impact pertains to a slider question, this
      indicates which direction of the slider corresponds to the appropriateness
      of the gift, either -1 or 1. 1 indicates that responses toward the right
      work towards the recommendation of the gift, and responses toward the left
      work against the recommendation. -1 indicates that responses toward the left
      work towards the recommendation, and responses toward the right work against.
      For non-slider question types, leave this field blank.

    %li
      Choice 1 Impact, 2, ..., 9, 10 - If the row is for a multiple choice question,
      the "choice" columns specify the impact of a specific choice, from -1 to 1. E.g.
      if a -1 is given here and a given quiz has this choice selected, it works against
      the recommendation of the gift. For other question types, leave these fields blank.
