  %h3 Format
  %p Each row is a single response to a single question.
  %p 
    The template spreadsheet has headers at the top to guide you. Do not remove the header
    row. Here is a description of the columns:
  %ol
    %li
      Survey Response Name - The same as the name given when you create a new
      response set in the interface. For the import, the name indicates which
      response set the responses are to be part of. If one with the same name already exists,
      any responses in the import will overwrite their corresponding responses
      given previously.
    %li
      Question Code - The code given when creating the question. This is used
      to match the response to the right one.
    %li
      Text Response - If the response is for a text question, that text goes
      here. For other question types leave it blank.
    %li
      Slider Response - If the response is for a slider question, the value
      (from -1 to 1) goes here. For other question types, leave it blank.
    %li
      Choice 1, 2, ..., 9, 10 -
      If the response is for a multiple choice question, the "choice"
      columns specify whether each option is chosen (on or off). They are
      expected to be in the same order that the options show up in the quiz.
      Putting a 1 in the column means selected, 0 or blank means not selected.
